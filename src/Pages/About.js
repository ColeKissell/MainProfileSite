                    My name is Nicole Kissell. I was born and raised in Utah.
                    I have always been interested in how things work. My first real experience with STEM related fields came in high school.
                    I was on the first team Alta High School had for the FIRST Robotics Competition, and attended the JATC's general engineering program.
                    In college I studied engineering and computer science. I attended Helio Training to get a more fast paced approach to learning computer science.
